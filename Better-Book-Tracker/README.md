# Better Book Tracker

Welcome to Better Book Tracker, a web application designed to help bibliophiles keep track of their book collections and reading progress. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it leverages the Open Library API to search for and add books to your personal library.

## Features

- **Book Search**: Search for books using the Open Library API and add them to your library with a single click.
- **Add Books Manually**: If a book is not found in the Open Library API, you can manually add it to your library by providing the title, author, description, and reading status.
- **Book Management**: View, edit, and delete books from your library.
- **Reading Status Tracking**: Keep track of your reading progress by marking books as "Read," "Want to Read," or "Currently Reading."
- **Local Storage**: Your book library is stored locally in your browser, so your data persists even after closing the application.
- **Book Status Chart**: A visual representation of your reading progress using a bar chart.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- Open Library API
- Chart.js (for the book status chart)

## Project Structure

- `CSS/Styles.css`: The CSS file that styles the application.
- `Javascript/Scripts.JS`: The JavaScript file that contains the application logic and functionality.

2. **Add Books to Library**: Click the "Add to Library" button next to a book in the search results to add it to your personal library.
3. **Add Books Manually**: If a book is not found in the Open Library API, you can manually add it to your library by filling out the "Add a book" form and clicking the "Add Book selection" button.
4. **Manage Books**: In your library, you can edit a book's details by clicking the "Edit" button, or delete a book by clicking the "Delete" button.
5. **Track Reading Status**: Each book in your library has a reading status indicator ("Read," "Want to Read," or "Currently Reading"). You can change a book's status by editing its details.
6. **View Book Status Chart**: A bar chart at the bottom of the page displays the distribution of books across the different reading statuses.
